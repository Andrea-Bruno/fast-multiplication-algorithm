## About the Author

Andrea Bruno, born in 1972, is an independent inventor and researcher with a lifelong passion for mathematics, physics, and artificial intelligence. Although he did not pursue formal academic qualifications, his intellectual aptitude has been recognized since an early age. During a physics examination in technical school, his professor publicly referred to him as a genius for solving a complex problem in an unconventional and elegant way. Later, Andrea achieved a perfect score of 160 on an IQ test, further affirming his natural analytical capabilities.

In the 1980s, he began developing early artificial intelligence algorithms, including a chess engine that was published in the magazine *CHIP*. Unlike traditional brute-force engines, his software was powered by a self-designed AI logic, demonstrating a pioneering approach to intelligent computation.

The mathematical and algorithmic work presented in this repository did not require extensive effort or formal tools. In fact, the core innovation—the fast multiplication algorithm—was conceived intuitively during sleep, without the need for pen, paper, or prolonged analysis. This intuitive process reflects Andrea’s unique cognitive style and his ability to internalize and synthesize complex systems with minimal external input.

Through this project, Andrea Bruno aims not only to contribute to the advancement of AI computation, but also to establish a clear and enduring association between his name and the intellectual property he has created.

## Project Vision

The Fast Multiplication Algorithm presented here is only one component of a broader initiative: the AI Accelerator project. This effort aims to develop a suite of computational tools specifically optimized for artificial intelligence workloads and scientific computing.

Several additional algorithms have already been conceived and are in development, each designed to enhance performance, efficiency, and scalability. The overarching goal is to create a modular framework of innovations that, when integrated, offer substantial improvements over general-purpose solutions.

To illustrate this concept, consider the analogy of automotive engineering. While a Formula 1 engine and a standard car engine may share similar materials and basic mechanical principles, the arrangement, precision, and advanced technologies employed in the former result in vastly superior performance. Likewise, the AI Accelerator project seeks to embed cutting-edge computational techniques into the "engine" of AI systems.

The Fast Multiplication Algorithm can be viewed as one such enhancement—akin to the transition from carburetors to fuel injectors in engine design. When paired with dedicated hardware, this algorithm represents a leap in computational efficiency, enabling faster and more energy-conscious processing.

Historically, companies like NVIDIA have leveraged GPU architectures originally designed for gaming, which—by fortunate coincidence—proved highly effective for AI computation. However, as both science and engineering demonstrate, general-purpose solutions are often outperformed by purpose-built technologies. This project embraces that principle, aiming to deliver targeted innovations that surpass conventional architectures in both raw performance and energy efficiency.

While the Fast Multiplication Algorithm is a key innovation, it is not intended to be presented as a standalone solution capable of accelerating AI computation on its own. The true impact emerges when multiple aspects of AI processing are optimized through targeted, purpose-built technologies. When each computational layer is enhanced with dedicated solutions, the cumulative effect yields significant improvements in both energy efficiency and computational throughput.

The AI Accelerator project already includes the design of additional algorithms and custom chip architectures aimed at accelerating AI workloads in other domains. These components will be published and disclosed progressively, forming part of a broader technical vision focused on high-performance, domain-specific computing for artificial intelligence.

## Presentation of the Algorithm Underlying Technological Innovation

The code presented below serves as a clear and academically rigorous demonstration of the logic and functioning of the fast multiplication algorithm. It is designed to be transparent and accessible, allowing researchers, engineers, and practitioners to understand the mathematical principles that underpin the innovation.

The implementation is written in C#, a widely adopted programming language chosen for its readability and accessibility. However, it is important to emphasize that the algorithm itself is language-independent. The computational logic and mathematical structure are universal and can be expressed in any programming environment or hardware architecture.

As evident from the example, the algorithm is currently implemented for execution on a CPU. Due to the byte-oriented architecture of conventional CPUs—organized into segments such as 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, or 64-bit units—the algorithm must accommodate certain structural complexities. These constraints influence how calculations are performed and how data is processed internally.

In contrast, when deployed on custom-designed hardware that is not segmented by byte boundaries, the computation becomes significantly more linear and efficient. The mathematical operations can be executed without the overhead imposed by traditional CPU architectures, resulting in simplified logic, higher performance, and substantial energy savings.

Therefore, the current CPU-based code should be interpreted as a mathematical demonstration of the algorithm’s core logic. It is intended to provide the academic and technical community with a reference model, while the ultimate goal remains the deployment of this algorithm within dedicated hardware environments optimized for AI acceleration.

### Demonstrative Purpose and Academic Validity

The algorithm implementation provided below is intended to serve as a demonstrative model of the underlying mathematical logic. In academic and technical contexts, a well-structured algorithm—expressed in code—can effectively substitute for a textual description of its functioning, offering clarity, precision, and reproducibility.

This example is written in C#, a widely adopted programming language chosen for its readability and accessibility. However, the algorithm itself is not bound to any specific language. Its core logic is language-agnostic and can be implemented in any computational environment, including hardware-level architectures.

It is important to note that the current implementation targets execution on conventional CPUs. Due to the segmented nature of CPU architectures—organized into byte-based units such as 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, or 64-bit—the algorithm must accommodate structural constraints that affect how data is processed and how operations are performed.

In contrast, when deployed on custom-designed hardware free from byte segmentation, the computation becomes significantly more linear and efficient. The absence of architectural fragmentation allows for simplified execution paths, reduced overhead, and enhanced performance, with corresponding gains in energy efficiency.

Therefore, the code presented here should be interpreted as a mathematical demonstration of the algorithm’s logic, intended to provide the academic and technical community with a transparent and verifiable reference. It does not represent the final optimized implementation, which will be adapted for dedicated hardware environments as part of the broader AI Accelerator initiative.

					if ((multiplier[by] & 1 << bt) != 0)
					{
						o[ad] = p;
						ad++;
					}
				if (p < multiplicand.Length * 8)
					for (var i = 0; i < ad; i++)
						s += (multiplicand[(p - o[i]) >> 3] & (1 << ((p - o[i]) & 7))) != 0 ? 1 : 0;
				else if (r == 0)
					return result;
				r += s;
				result[by] |= (byte)((r & 1) << bt);
				r >>= 1;
			}
			return result;
		}
